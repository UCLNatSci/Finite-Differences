    "We can compute a series expansion for a function in powers of $x$ using Taylor series. The resulting truncated polynomial gives a good local approximation to a function in a sense made precise by the Lagrange remainder theorem. If the truncated polynomial is used near the expansion point $a$ then its accuracy \"goes like\" the $n^{\\text{th}}$ power of the distance from $a$.\n",

    "Not all functions are faithfully represented by their Taylor Series. We have only guaranteed that the polynomial has the \"correct\" behaviour in the immediate vicinity of the point $x=a$. Two things should be checked:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does the series converge to a finite value for all $x$? <br>\n",
    "We can find the radius of convergence by using the ratio test\n",
    "1. Does it converge to $f(x)$? <br>\n",
    "We must show that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{k\\rightarrow \\infty}|f(x)-p_k(x;a)|=0$, which may only be true for some values of $x$.\n",
    "This can be done by making use of the Lagrange remainder theorem, introduced in the next subsection.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions which converge to their Taylor series are called analytic, and functions which converge to their Taylor series everywhere are called entire. The sine and cosine series, and the $e^x$ series are entire. The Maclaurin series for $\\ln(1+x)$ is analytic for $|x|<1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical use\n",
    "The Taylor series nearly always contains an infinite number of terms. To be of practical use in numeric applications, we need to \"truncate\" the expansion, meaning that we retain only the terms up to a specified $n^{\\text{th}}$ power of $x$. As well as considering the validity of the infinite series, it is important to be able to determine how many terms in the series are needed for practical use. If the series converges very slowly, then it may not be much good!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lagrange remainder theorem, given in the box below, allows us to place precise bounds on the size of the error. The result shows that the error in the truncated expansion is proportional to the next power of $(x-a)$.\n",

    "The power-relationship in Lagrange's theorem can be anticipated when $(x-a)$ is small, and for larger differences by noting that factorial growth (of the coefficient denominators) is much faster than algebraic (polynomial) growth. The proof, and derivation of the coefficient of $(x-a)^n$ is found by using the mean value theorem. It won't be of much benefit for our practical purposes to show the proof here, but I'm happy to provide it if you want to see it. Instead, let us take a look at an illustrative example.\n",

The sketch indicates that the slope of the secant line between adjacent coordinates gives a better approximation to the gradient at the midpoint of the interval than at either of the endpoints.\n",

    "In the above example we allowed python to compute the grid points, by using linspace to ensure that the right-hand end point was included. However, for some applications it may not be convenient to use linspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to compute the step size $h$ that will discretise a domain with the right-hand end point included, it is useful to recognise that the $x$ values in the grid are in arithmetic progression. If the first term is $a$, then the last term is $a+(n-1)h$, where $n$ is the number of points. This gives the following result for an interval $[a,b]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}a+(n-1)h=b \\quad \\Rightarrow\\quad h=\\frac{b-a}{n-1}\\end{equation}$$\n",

    "Assuming again an equal grid spacing $h$, we can use either of the following two results\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle y_k^{\\prime}\\simeq\\frac{y_{k+1/2}-y_{k-1/2}}{h}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This result requires the function values at the midpoint of each pair of grid values. It is convenient to relabel the index, so that the subscript on the right had side of the formula matches the numbering of the gridpoints, giving $y_{k+1/2}^{\\prime}\\simeq\\frac{y_{k+1}-y_{k}}{h}$. This result is identical to the forward derivative estimate, but it should be interpreted as the derivative of the function at the mid-point of each interval, rather than at the left-hand point.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle y_k^{\\prime}=\\frac{y_{k+1}-y_{k-1}}{2h}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This result gives an estimate of the derivative at the original grid locations for the derivative at the interior points $[x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_{n-1}]$. Computing the derivative at the two end-points requires the function value $y$ at phantom exterior points $x_{0}$ and $x_{n+1}$, as shown below, which is given to match the example in the previous section."

    "### Demonstrating the truncation error\n",
    "To illustrate the accuracy of the formulae, we can compute the maximum error in the approximation for a range of step sizes and plot the result. Since the resulting errors $E$ are proportional to $h^n$, a plot of $\\ln(E)$ against $\\ln(h)$ should show a linear relationship. The gradient of the line gives the estimated order of the truncation error, $n$. We find (as expected) that the formula based on forward differences has a first order error relationship and the formula based on central differences has a quadratic order error relationship."

    "\n",
    "Truncation errors occur due to working with finite approximations to infinitesimal quantities, whilst the roundoff errors are a computational artefact due to working with finite precision arithmetic. Numeric computation packages ordinarily use floating point representation of numbers which are very efficient and represent numbers faithfully to around 16 digits. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to increase the working precision of a calculation to a specified degree by using variable-precision arithmetic. However, this results in a significant slowdown in computational speed. For most practical purposes, floating point precision is sufficient.\n",

    "### Numeric solution of an initial value problem\n",

    "$$y(x_k+h)= y(x_k)+y^{\\prime}(x_k)h+\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$$\n",

    "$$\\begin{equation}y(x_k+h)= y(x_k)+f(x_k)h+\\mathcal{O}(h^2)\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula uses the known value $(x_k,y_k)$ together with the known slope at that point to project forward to the next point. The calculation is then repeated at the new point, and in this manner we keep stepping forward until we reach the end of the integration domain. We start at the given initial value $(x_0,y_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graphical illustration is provided below, demonstrating how each forward step takes us in tangent to one of the family of general solution curves. The approximation would be better for smaller step size!\n",

    "### Local and global errors\n",
    "The trunctation error in the explicit Euler method is order $h^2$. It is the size of error introduced at each step. As we are integrating over $1/h$ steps, we may therefore expect that by the time we reach the end of the integration domain the error may be \"going like\" $h$. We say that the local error is order $h^2$ and the global error is order $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This heuristic description is fairly accurate. However, the detailed picture is a little more complicated, as for some problems the local errors are amplified/compounded in subsequent steps, whilst in other problems the errors are damped out. We will see some examples in the next section.\n",

However, Taylor’s theorem is required to quantify the size of the analytic error in each case.\n",

    "So far we have only looked at initial value problems of the form $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}=f(x)$, where the derivative is given fully in terms of $x$. Differential equations which do not explicitly depend on the independent variable are called autonomous.\n",

    "In each plot, the numeric estimate is shown in blue and the analytic solution is shown in red. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the explicit and implicit Euler solutions have the same level of accuracy over a single step. However, in this example the errors in the explicit solution are amplified, whilst in the implicit solution they are damped. The implicit method is more stable for this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Analysis for this problem</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "This example can be fully analysed by hand. Since it is linear, a root finding method is not needed to implement the backward formula. We can simply rearrange to obtain an explicit solution for $y_k$. In both cases, the resulting expression for $y_{k+1}$ can be applied recursively to obtain a closed form discrete solution in terms of the step size $h$ and the initial condition $y_0$. The details for each method are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **explicit formula** gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle y_{k+1}= (1-5h)y_k \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y_{k+1}=(1-5h)^{k+1}y_0, \\qquad x=kh$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **implicit formula** gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle y_{k+1}=\\frac{y_k}{1+5h} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y_{k+1}=\\frac{y_0}{(1+5h)^{k+1}}, \\qquad x=kh$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\displaystyle \\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}(1\\pm 5 h)^{x/h} = e^{\\pm 5x}$, both of these results converge to the analytic solution $y=2e^{-5x}$ in the limit of small step sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for $|1-5h|>1$, the explicit Euler method displays oscillating growth (i.e. for $h>2/5$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for (dynamically) stable ODEs with a fast decaying or highly oscillatory mode, the explicit Euler method demands small step sizes. These types of ODE are called \"stiff\". The implicit Euler method is also more stable than the trapezoidal method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is stability assessed in practical problems?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison of the local and global errors can give us an indication of the stability properties of the algorithm. The local errors generally ought to remain proportional to the size of the neglected terms in the truncated expansion. If these errors are growing then the algorithm is not stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the error at each step depends on the method used and also the problem being solved. In particular, it depends on how large the gradient is. To account for this, and to produce a reliable result within specified error tolerances, many algorithms use adaptive step size methods, in which the error is estimated at each step by comparing the results from algorithms with different numbers of stages. The step size can then be decreased in regions where the tolerance would be exceeded. Python scipy package offers a built-in algorithm that does exactly this, called integrate.solve_ivp\n",

    "As an alternative to using Newton-Raphson algorithm to find the root of an algebraic relationship, we can use a fixed-point iteration technique, designed for problems of the form $\\begin{equation}x=F(x).\\end{equation}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The approach proceeds by taking an initial guess $x=x_{guess}$ and substituting it into the right hand side of the equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $|x_{guess}-F(x_{guess})|$ is less than some specified tolerance then we conclude that our guess is a good approximation to the root.\n",

    "Explicit Runge Kutta algorithms are a general class of multi-stage methods that use weighted averages of slope estimates obtained at different points within a single step (e.g. at a half-step) to reduce the truncation error. These algorithms can be highly accurate, so larger step sizes can be taken, but they may also exhibit less stability than lower order algorithms. The stability can be assessed by comparison of more than one technique or comparison of the results for different step sizes. Some algorithms use these comparisons to improve efficiency by using an adaptive step size.\n",

Seeing how the techniques are implemented also provides good Python experience.\n",
