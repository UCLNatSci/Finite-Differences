    "The methods seen in the previous chapter used a single calculation step to define the relationship between each neighbouring pair of solution points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will look at a general class of multi-stage methods that use weighted averages of slope estimates obtained at different points within a single step (e.g. at a half-step) to reduce the truncation error. These algorithms can be highly accurate, so larger step sizes can be taken, but they may also exhibit less stability than lower order algorithms. The stability can be assessed by comparison of more than one technique or comparison of the results for different step sizes. Some algorithms use these comparisons to improve efficiency by using an adaptive step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge of multi-stage methods is not crucial for this module, as the techniques that we will develop for solving higher order ODEs and partial differential equations are based on single stage methods. However, the material in this chapter gives some insight about methods employed by `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` to improve accuracy and manage stability. Seeing how the techniques are implemented may also provide good Python experience.\n",

    "This result requires the solutions for both the previous value $y_k$ and $y_{k+1/2}$. However, we can use Euler's explicit formula with a half-step to estimate this value. Due to the nesting of the approximation this does not affect the accuracy of the method, which remains quadratic order. The resulting explicit algorithm, which is known as the modified Euler scheme can be calculated via a two-stage process:\n",
