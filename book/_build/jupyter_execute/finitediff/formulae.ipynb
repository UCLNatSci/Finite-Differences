    "We can truncate and manipulate Taylor's series to obtain algebraic approximation for first and second (and higher) derivatives involving weighted averages of neighbouring points. These approximations may allow us to compute derivatives with greater accuracy for a given step size.\n",

    "## Taylor series recap\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compute a power series representation for a function $f(x)$ by Taylor expansion about a chosen point $x=a$. If we keep only a finite number of terms then the *truncated* polynomial gives a good approximation in a local neighbourhood of the expansion point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"goodness\" of the approximation can be anticipated using the Lagrange remainder theorem, which places an upper bound on the size of the error. The error in the truncated expansion is found to be proportional to the next power of $(x-a)$ that was discarded in the expansion.\n",

    "A mathematical summary of these results is given below, and further details can be found in [NSCI0005 Lecture Notes, Chapter 7 on Taylor Series](https://uclnatsci.github.io/Mathematics-for-Natural-Sciences/sequences_and_series/taylor_series.html)\n",

    "If we label $h=(x-x_k)$, then we may rewrite the expression as shown below. The result is known as Euler's forward difference formula or the explicit Euler method.\n",

    "\n",
    " The error occurs due to working with finite approximations to infinitesimal quantities, and is a result of truncating the Taylor expansion after just two terms. We should distinguish **truncation error** from the previously seen **roundoff errors** that occur as a computational artefact due to working with finite precision arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finite difference formulae\n",
    "\n",
    "We can derive other finite difference formulas that from Taylor's series, by taking weighted sums of expansions about different points to eliminate unwanted terms in the series. Some of them are favoured because they exhibit higher order accuracy than Euler's formula (reduced truncation error), whilst others may be favoured in practical applications for their numeric stability, computational efficiency or ease of practical implementation. A few examples of finite difference formulas are given below, though this list is far from exhaustive.\n",
