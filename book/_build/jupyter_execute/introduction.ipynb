    "We can compute a series expansion for a function in powers of $x$ using Taylor series. The resulting truncated polynomial gives a good local approximation to a function in a sense made precise by the Lagrange remainder theorem. If the truncated polynomial is used near the expansion point $a$ then its accuracy \"goes like\" the $n^{\\text{th}}$ power of the distance from $a$.\n",

    "We choose the coefficients $c_n$ to ensure that the $n^{\\text{th}}$ derivative of the polynomial is equal to the $n^{\\text{th}}$ derivative of the function at the point $x=a$. In this sense, the Taylor series gives the best possible local polynomial approximation to $f(x)$ of specified degree. By repeatedly differentiating and evaluating the polynomial, we obtain\n",

    "Not all functions are faithfully represented by their Taylor Series. We have only guaranteed that the polynomial has the \"correct\" behaviour in the immediate vicinity of the point $x=a$. Two things should be checked:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does the series converge to a finite value for all $x$? <br>\n",
    "We can find the radius of convergence by using the ratio test\n",
    "1. Does it converge to $f(x)$? <br>\n",
    "We must show that $\\displaystyle \\lim_{k\\rightarrow \\infty}|f(x)-p_k(x;a)|=0$, which may only be true for some values of $x$.\n",
    "This can be done by making use of the Lagrange remainder theorem, introduced in the next subsection.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions which converge to their Taylor series are called analytic, and functions which converge to their Taylor series everywhere are called entire. The sine and cosine series, and the $e^x$ series are entire. The Maclaurin series for $\\ln(1+x)$ is analytic for $|x|<1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical use\n",
    "The Taylor series nearly always contains an infinite number of terms. To be of practical use in numeric applications, we need to \"truncate\" the expansion, meaning that we retain only the terms up to a specified $n^{\\text{th}}$ power of $x$. As well as considering the validity of the infinite series, it is important to be able to determine how many terms in the series are needed for practical use. If the series converges very slowly, then it may not be much good!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lagrange remainder theorem, given in the box below, allows us to place precise bounds on the size of the error. The result shows that the error in the truncated expansion is proportional to the next power of $(x-a)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The power-relationship in Lagrange's theorem can be anticipated when $(x-a)$ is small, and for larger differences by noting that factorial growth (of the coefficient denominators) is much faster than algebraic (polynomial) growth. The proof, and derivation of the coefficient of $(x-a)^n$ is found by using the mean value theorem. It won't be of much benefit for our practical purposes to show the proof here, but I'm happy to provide it if you want to see it. Instead, let us take a look at an illustrative example.\n",

    "Since $|\\cos(\\xi)|$ is bounded above by $1$ on the given domain, Lagrange's remainder theorem gives an upper bound of $\\frac{\\pi^3}{6^4}=0.0239246$\n",

    "This result, which is illustrated graphically below, is familiar from our early work on calculus. The derivative is formally defined as the limiting case where $h\\rightarrow 0$.

Some applications of this approximation are given in the next sections of the notes.\n",

    "There are other finite difference formulas that can be obtained from Taylor's series, by taking weighted sums of expansions about different points to eliminate unwanted terms in the series.

A few examples of finite difference formulas are given below, though this list is far from exhaustive.\n",

    "Euler's formula is rarely used in problems of real practical importance, as it often requires impractically small integration steps to achieve the required accuracy goal. However, it does appear as a sub-step in some other important formulas that we will encounter in the section on multistep methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central difference formulas are of particular importance. They are very heavily used in numeric methods because they achieve a good balance between simplicity, stability and accuracy. The central difference formulas estimate the slope at each point by using a weighted combination of points on each side. The graphic below provides an indication of why this usually gives a better estimate. The sketch indicates that the slope of the secant line between adjacent coordinates gives a better approximation to the gradient at the midpoint of the interval than at either of the endpoints.\n",
