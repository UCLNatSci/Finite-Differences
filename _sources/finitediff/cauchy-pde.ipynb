    "**Concerning the given result for : $\\phi(\\Delta t,x)$**\n",
    "The given result came from the analytic solution for the undamped case (when $\\gamma=0$). Whoever wrote this question must have believed it would give a good approximation to the analytic solution for the undamped case. However, the result given by using this condition is unphysical. Our numeric solution rightly shows a travelling wave of decaying amplitude, but the staggered rate of decay doesn't match reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hand derivations indicate that the PDE admit particular solutions of the form $\\phi=e^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}t}\\sin(kx-\\omega t)$, where $\\omega^2=k^2c^2 -\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)^2$. If this analytic result is used to determine $\\phi(\\Delta t,x)$, the amplitude will be seen to decay exponentially with rate determined by the strength of the damping. This finding highlights again the importance of taking great care with the accurate implementation of any boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if we can't use an analytic solution to determine $\\phi(\\Delta t,x)$?**\n",
    "In that case, we could determine the result from a pair of initial conditions of the form $\\phi(0,x)=f(x)$, $\\phi_t(0,x)=g(x)$, by using the central difference formula for the first derivative boundary condition, in conjunction with the update rule given by the PDE. This is the method used in the previous question for the undamped case.\n",
    "The functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ would need to be informed by the physical problem. The solution would (likely) not be a single travelling harmonic, but would consist of a wavepacket (sum of) harmonics.\n",
